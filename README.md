# My laptop is faster than your Elastic cluster

This is a title of my blog post describing my experiment of running a task of matching 5,000 real estate properties against 5M of saved searches (subscriptions to be notified about the new matching properties). This is a standard task running daily on the popular real estate platforms.

REA Group uses a dedicated Elastic cluster to run this task. I decided to check whether a laptop can handle this workload.

Disclaimer: I do not state that this solution is better in any way than the one architected by REA Group's engineers. The only purpose of this exercise is to show it might be worth exploring simple alternatives to expensive technical solutions.
